My favorite comic actor is Steve Carell.

One of my main goal after this class is to be able to create a **reproducible research workflow**.
By that I mean create a Rmarkdown file where I have a mix of code and text as in the example you showed in the first class (if I remember well).
The problem is that I use mainly Python and although I looked at some doc online I do not manage to import my Anaconda envs properly so I can do basic Python code but not more so far... I am stuck here.
This could definitly be **my semester project**!

What would also be cool is to create a personal website where one could put his CV, research projects and so on.
This could also be a very useful semester project.
